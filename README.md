# Easy Page Statistics

Easy Page Statistics is a simple way of checking how many likes or posts one or several facebook pages has received overall or during a specific time period.

## Installation

Simply download the index.html file and open it in any modern browser.

## Usage

When the index.html is opened, you are presented with a table as well as various buttons. For every site you wish to have statistics on, add a new row and enter its facebook URL into the "Page Url" field. You can choose to filter on specific date ranges by checking the "Filter by dates" checkbox.

When you have entered all of the information you must log in via Facebook to obtain a so called access token - an authorization from Facebook to view the data. No information is recorded and no permissions are required.

The Likes and Posts fields will start updating, and when they have stopped you have the final statistic.
